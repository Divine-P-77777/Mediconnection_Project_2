      <h2 className={subHeadingClass + " text-xl"}>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>

        initiated within <strong>2 working days</strong> of the cancellation request.
      </p>

      <h2 className={subHeadingClass + " text-xl"}>Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        MediConnection is only a platform to connect patients with health centers and doctors.
