Payment  WorkFlow
Patient → Cashfree PG → Merchant Balance → Settlement → Merchant Bank
                                                       ↓
                                                  Payout API (80%)
                                                  Doctor Bank



                                                  Flow of Money in Cashfree
1. PG Settlement Balance (Customer → Merchant)

When a patient pays (₹100), Cashfree collects it.

This goes into your PG Settlement Balance.

After the settlement cycle (T+1 or T+2 working days), Cashfree automatically credits this to your merchant bank account (the account you registered while onboarding).

⚠️ You cannot control or reroute this money into the payout wallet. It always flows to your bank account.

2. Payout Wallet (Merchant → Doctor)

To pay doctors/vendors, you use Cashfree Payouts.

Cashfree deducts payouts directly from your Payout Wallet balance, not from PG settlement.

This means:

Even if you receive money from patients, you must top up the payout wallet (via NEFT/IMPS/UPI from your merchant bank account).

Then, when you call the /requestTransfer API, the money comes out of that wallet and goes to the doctor’s bank/UPI.

3. No Auto-Link

PG Settlement and Payout Wallet are separate buckets.

PG Settlement → always goes to your bank account.

Payout Wallet → needs manual recharge from your side.

🔹 So, in your case:

Patient pays ₹100.

Cashfree will settle ₹100 – fees to your merchant bank account in 2 days.

If you want to pay the doctor ₹80 instantly, you must keep at least ₹80 in your payout wallet.

Later, when Cashfree settles money to your bank account, that replenishes your main funds, and you can top-up the payout wallet again.
